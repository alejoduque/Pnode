[13:59] <ham87> according to wiki
[13:59] <k-man> maybe they would be scared to operate
[14:00] <k-man> ham87: oh thats interesting
[14:00] <maradydd> I've got nice resonators for 20 and 40

[14:13] <egypt14> ham87: are you saying there is active blocking?
[14:13] <egypt14> Syameimar: yes, i hear - is there any way to relay intenret apart from satelite?
[14:13] <jfalcon> hmm... are there any 4X stations up on echolink?
[14:14] <ham87>  not sure - it's Eilat city rescue team's APRS repeater - they may just not allow external connections to that node
[14:14] <jfalcon> guess I can find out myself...
[14:14] <ham87> there are a few 4x's - one in tel aviv that i'll try
[14:14] <ham87> 4x6hf
[14:14] <maradydd> go bus go

[14:21] <ats> do you guys have any idea of what bands and modes Egyptian operators normally use -- i.e. that they're likely to have kit and antennas for?
[14:21] <jfalcon> probably HF and VHF/UHF
[14:21] <egypt11> GREAT NEWS: Protesters takeover Tahreer Square completely. Police fled. It's ours. Protesters are so many. Police are trying to get on top of buildings. Reports of death in Tahrir square one of them is an old lady protester

[15:02] <maradydd> hm, really big zip ties might work
[15:02] <maradydd> couple more mins and i'll have an estimate of how heavy this thing is going to be
[15:03] <ats> maradydd: if you're bodging it, make sure you've got it tied off with a safety rope as well (so it doesn't fall and hit someone/damage the aerial)

[15:07] <maradydd> hm, lighter than i thought it would be. the mast with two resonators is maybe a kilo? kilo and a half? i'm guessing, but it's not heavy overall
[15:07] <maradydd> it is, however, quite top heavy
[15:08] <maradydd> ats: loop a rope around it and secure on both sides so it doesn't fall outward, you think?

[15:25] <maradydd> and that's largely because most people aren't in range. I'm about to tune these antennas and then I'll be calling cq from belgium

[17:03] <maradydd> gotta jump on a call for work
[17:03] <h> What is correct?
[17:03] <@n0pants> maradydd: Morning!

[17:05] <N6ILG> What would I need to stream anyway?  (in case it gets better)

[19:00] <@n0pants> if we can get a straight audio feed, we can restream via icecast,

[20:29] <@n0pants> thank you all for your patience
[20:29] <ratzz> someothers need to tune around and either record or decode.
[20:29] <wd40> i will shortly be setting up a tor bridge for egyptians if a ham would pass on the ip that would be cool

[23:49] <hb9ssb> DF5JT, it is not about making political statements, but to provide a comm channel.

[23:51] <@ratzz> ah ha,, yeah, right.
[23:51] <@ratzz> latest word from Dept. of State: support will be examined in light of new situation
[23:51] <dasmi> Most of the time I love it, but then when our embarassing and often evil entanglements with other governments come to light, its sad.
[23:51] <DF5JT> Please understand: Ham radio operators in Egypt are OK. They are not the ones in the streets.
[23:51] <Mrafrohea> dasmi i thought it was pretty funny
[23:52] <@ratzz> DF5JT: ok. that's good news.
[23:52] <Mrafrohea> they should act ethically, then they won't have shit to hide
[23:52] <dasmi> Exactly.
[23:52] <dasmi> But governments are rarely ethical.
[23:52] <Mrafrohea>  <dasmi> So...sorry about that.  It's kind of a bummer to be an american sometimes.

[23:52] <Mrafrohea> it is not the other way around.
[23:52] <@ratzz> i think a diplomat would point out that ethical for a State is not always the same as ethics for an individual
[23:52] <dasmi> I really hope that when America has its Egypt moment, people around the world remember that the american people are not the american government.

[00:18] <n0UNL> i'm talking about the old school analog ones, yes?
[00:18] <Sorinan> the idea isn't have a Mesh network? why directional antennas?
[00:18] <DF5JT> You can use any satellite dish for any band. It's the feeder that makes the difference.
[00:18] <n0UNL> o?
[00:18] <sxpert> Sorinan: because directional allows for better signal / noise ratio
[00:18] <sxpert> Sorinan: and better data speeds

[00:19] <n0UNL> well i was interested in satalite VHF, could i use a small portable thing on 2m?

[03:14] <egypt03> good
[03:15] <allenk> How much bandwidth are you using with like 150 people listening? :D
[03:16] <egypt03> the stream is pretty low: 24kbps X 160
[03:16] <egypt03> we have 100mbps of bw
[03:17] <allenk> yeah
[03:17] <allenk> You don't need much for radio
[03:17] <allenk> radio sounds like shit to begin with
[03:17] <egypt03> we are only using like 4mbps
[03:18] <egypt03> i guess you are tired of telling what antenna you are using.. but if you can repeat
